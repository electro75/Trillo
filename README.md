# Trillo

This is mock web page of a booking details section.

Can be run by cloning this project and opening the index.html file.

## Concepts : 

### Flexbox
- This is page is mainly built on the various properties that *CSS FLEXBOX* has to provide.
    ```
        flex: 0 0 18%;
        // shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis;
    ```
    - `flex-grow`: defines how the element should grow when the size of the container increases.
    - `flex-shrink`: defines how the element shrinks when the size of the container is reduced.
    - `flex-basis`: defines how much width the element will occupy.

    ```
    flex: 1
    // the element will cover the entire remaining space.
    ```
